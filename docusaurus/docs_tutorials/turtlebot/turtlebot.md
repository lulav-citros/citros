# TurtleBot3

## Overview
This project is designed to wrap the official [TurtleBot3 simulation example](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation) and integrate it with a simple Autonomous Collision Avoidance node. <br />
The project gives users the flexibility to modify various TurtleBot3 specifications by changing ROS 2 parameters. These parameters may include attributes like the robot's size, speed, sensor range, or collision avoidance algorithms. Users can experiment with different parameter values to observe their impact on collision avoidance behavior. The TurtleBot3 robot is capable of orienting itself effectively within a prepared TurtleBot3 world. It utilizes the simulated lidar module to gather environmental data, allowing it to make informed decisions about its navigation path.<br/>
All project installation, code overview and usage details are also available on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/citros-garden/turtlebot3).

## Prerequisites

1. Please make sure you have all the [necessary softwares](../../docs/guides/getting_started#prerequisites-for-working-with-citros) to work with CITROS installed on your computer.
2. Install [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. We strongly recommend that you work with [dockers](../../docs/guides/dockerfile_overview). However, if you wish to work without dockers, please refer to the .devcontainer [directory](https://github.com/citros-garden/aerosandbox_cessna/tree/main/.devcontainer) in project's repo, the dependencies you need are in the ```Dockerfile``` file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:citros-garden/turtlebot3.git
```
2. Open the repository in the [VScode Dev Container](../../docs/guides/getting_started#open-project-in-vscode-dev-container).

## Workspace Overview

The Turtlebot simulation has the following ROS 2 parameters:

|Parameter	|Description	|Package
|--|--|--
separation		|wheel separation	|turtlebot3_gazebo
radius		|wheel radius	|turtlebot3_gazebo
check_forward_dist_param		|forward checking distance for Autonomous Collision Avoidance	|turtlebot3_gazebo
check_side_dist_param		|side checking distance for Autonomous Collision Avoidance	|turtlebot3_gazebo


This project contains two launch files, we use ```turtlebot3_sim_cont.launch.py``` to run a simulation, while the second file launches automatically.

|Launch File	|Description	|Package
|--|--|--
turtlebot3_sim_cont.launch.py		|Gazebo headless TurtleBot world launch file 	|turtlebot3_gazebo
robot_state_publisher.launch.py		|Utility launch file for state publishing  |turtlebot3_gazebo


## CITROS Initialization
1. [Install CITROS](https://citros.io/doc/docs_tutorials/getting_started/#installation).
2. Follow [these steps](https://citros.io/doc/docs_tutorials/getting_started/#initialization) to Initialize CITROS.

Now you can see .citros directory in the explorer.

## Scenario
In this scenario the ROS 2 node interfaces with the official TurtleBot3 simulation example, leveraging the TurtleBot3 robot model and simulated environment. <br/>
This integration allows users to observe how the robot behaves in a controlled environment.<br/>
The node includes a simple Autonomous Collision Avoidance module which ensures the TurtleBot3 avoids collisions with obstacles in its path, it utilizes sensor data, such as simulated lidar readings, to detect obstacles and adjust the robot's trajectory accordingly. The output of the simulation is a robot's trajectory, sensors outputs and other [standard TurtleBot3 ROS 2 topics](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/robotis_framework_packages/).<br/>

In this tutorial, we will examine the powerful CITROS Error Analysis (a part of Data Analysis) package. We will analyze data from IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), Odometer and position information. <br/>
For that, we need to set up parameters and launch CITROS simulation. The parameter setup is listed in ```.citros/parameter_setups/default_param_setup.json```:
```json
{
    "packages": {
        "turtlebot3_gazebo": {
            "turtlebot3_gazebo": {
                "ros__parameters": {
                    "wheels": {
                        "radius": 0.05,
                        "separation": 0.16
                    },
                    "check_forward_dist_param": 0.7,
                    "check_side_dist_param": 0.6,
                    "joint_states_frame": "base_footprint",
                    "odom_frame": "odom",
                    "base_frame": "base_footprint"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Learn more about parameter setup and defining custom functions in [Directory parameter_setups](../../docs/advanced_guides/citros_structure#directory-simulations) and [Adding Functions to Parameter Setup](../../docs/guides/config_params) pages.

In addition to parameter setup, you can configure the simulation performance setup (timeout, CPU, GPU and Memory) as well.
This parameters can be found in ```.citros/simulations/simulation_turtlebot3_sim_cont.json```. <br/>
Look in [Directory simulations page](../../docs/advanced_guides/citros_structure#directory-simulations) for more information.

## Running the Scenario Using CITROS

Follow these steps to [Run Simulation](../../docs/guides/getting_started#run-simulation):
1. Name your  batch run simulation: `turtlebot3`
2. Add a message to your batch run simulation: `local test run`
3. Run your simulation ** 5 times **.

All the results will be saved under `.citros/data/simulation_turtlebot3` folder.

## Results

1. [Create Database](../../docs/guides/getting_started#create-db)
2. [Upload data to the database](../../docs/guides/getting_started#load-data-to-db)
3. [Verify the data was loaded](../../docs/guides/getting_started#verify-data-loaded)
4. [Execute the Notebook](../../docs/guides/getting_started#execute-notebook) `turtlebot_notebook_example.ipynb`. <br/>
You will find the notebook under `citros_template/notebooks` folder.

As you can see, the traveled trajectory varies for different simulations:
