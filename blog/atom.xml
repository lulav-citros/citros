        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the Beresheet lunar mission, Lulav Space, an Israeli startup specializing in space applications, has developed CITROS, a cloud-based robotic software validation platform. Built on ROS 2, CITROS allows easy integration of various robotic systems, provides parallel simulation on the cloud and powerful data analysis and reporting capabilities with an intuitive Python-based API. In this talk, we will present CITROS to the ROS community, highlighting its benefits, CI/CD capabilities, and open source contributions. The talk targets individuals interested in ROS, cloud computing, DevOps, and simulation.]]></summary>
